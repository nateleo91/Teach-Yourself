# Teach Yourself - Using Lua and wxLua

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Lua and wxLua to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a game launcher.

## Prerequisites

To use Lua and wxLua in your own projects, you will need to install Lua and wxLua on your system. You can find installation instructions for Lua and wxLua on their respective websites.

## Usage

To run the example launcher, follow these steps:

1. Install Lua and wxLua on your system.
2. Clone or download the Teach-Yourself repository.
3. Navigate to the `Teach-Yourself` directory in your terminal.
4. Run the `Launcher.sh` script using the command `lua Launcher.sh`.

## About Lua and wxLua

Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language designed for embedded systems and scripting. It is often used in game development, mobile app development, and web development.

wxLua is a Lua binding to the wxWidgets GUI toolkit, which allows you to create native-looking GUI applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Alternatives

There are many other GUI toolkits available for Lua, including IUP, FLTK, and Sciter.

## History and Maintainers

Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes.

wxLua was created in 2005 by John Labenski and Julian Smart. It is currently maintained by a team of developers on GitHub.

## My Opinion

As a language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, Lua and wxLua are popular choices for creating GUI applications in Lua, and they are widely used in the game development industry.
